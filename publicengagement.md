I am passionate about maximising the impact of my research through public engagement and knowledge exchange. In addition to delivering outreach workshops through my role at the University of Lincoln, I lead and contribute to activities that involve the dissemination of findings from my research through channels that can be accessed by the public and fellow academics.
