I am a Lecturer in the [School of Sport and Exercise Science](https://www.lincoln.ac.uk/home/sport/) and member of the [Health Advancement Research Team](https://www.hartresearch.org.uk/) at the [University of Lincoln, UK](https://www.lincoln.ac.uk/home/). The focus of my research is on understanding the personal and situational factors that relate to optimising peopleâ€™s experiences and psychological wellbeing across a range of contexts, including sport, exercise, doctoral education, and the workplace. Within the sport and exercise realms, I am currently involved in projects investigating flow states, clutch performance, goal setting, affect, and low energy availability. Beyond this, my research also examines psychological wellbeing in doctoral students and policing.
