Drawing together my educational and sporting backgrounds, I provide sport psychology and performance lifestyle support to athletes on a consultancy basis. I am certified in Talented Athlete Lifestyle Support (Level 3) and aim to help athletes reach their potential both inside and outside the competitive arena. 

Additionally, I deliver educational psychology workshops to athletes across a range of sports and to audiences in non-sporting contexts, such as in workplace and educational settings. Previously I was a performance analyst for a senior inter-county hurling team in Ireland for two seasons and provided performance analysis support to several club hurling teams.
