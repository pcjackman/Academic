My research interests have expanded over the last number of years. Initially I focused primarily on flow states in sport, but my research interests have broadened to other related psychological constructs and shifted into different contexts. Overall, I tend to adopt a positive psychology approach in my work, which emphasises the importance of understanding the positive aspects of human experience and how they can be facilitated. The majority of my research coheres around two themes:

*Optimal experiences in sport and exercise*

> This work seeks to understand the positive, rewarding experiences that athletes and exercisers have when engaged in these activities, with the ultimate goal of this work being to develop recommendations to help people reach and prolong these experiences more consistently. Central concepts in this work include flow states, clutch performance, performance under pressure, goal setting, affect, and self-regulation. 


*Psychological wellbeing*

> My research in psychological wellbeing focuses on understanding the factors that can help to promote better psychological wellbeing in individuals and communities. I am leading and collaborating on research projects in this area in sport, exercise, doctoral (PhD) students, and police employees.  

I supervise doctoral projects spanning both themes and welcome applications for doctoral study in any areas within or related to my research interests.

In addition to the research publications listed in reverse chronological order below, I have also led research projects commissioned by external organisations.
